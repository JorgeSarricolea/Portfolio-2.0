# [Portfolio-2.0](https://jorgesarricolea.com)
This is version 2.0 of my portfolio, in this portfolio I have defined a new color palette, more pages and projects in it.

## Description
First of all, I designed the UI from scratch on Figma, [click here](https://www.figma.com/file/276zzqR21HIVWiWWdrB4yT/Portfolio-2.0?node-id=41%3A149&t=XgIvxJdqrrlRzmaq-1) if you want to check out.
